# ボッチスタートアップ開始から三年経った結果…

I’ve spent most of the past 3 years creating one language learning web-app,
ある言語を学習するウェブアプリ[Readlang](http://readlang.com)を創りだすのに、ほぼ過去3年全部を使った。

[ほぼ2年前、地面から飛び立つための私の奮闘について書いた](http://steveridout.com/2014/03/22/readlang-my-bootstrapped-language-
learning-web-app.html)、そして、[ハッカーニュース](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7450519)やその他メディアの反応ワクワクしていた。
長い間続編を書こうとずっと思っていた。でも、いつも自分自信に「待て…まだだ」と言い聞かせてきたのかも知れない。

Well here I am, three years later. Usage didn’t explode, but grew in fits and
starts. I’ve worked hard for 3 years and am _still making less than minimum
wage_. But that’s not as bad as it might sound.

To survive as a bootstrapper, revenue is essential. But it’s often taboo,
despite being very useful information. The problem is that if you report a low
revenue, you may not be taken seriously. If you earn a lot, people listen but
it invites competition and jealousy. I’m still on the low side, so here goes…

New signups grew from 2,800 in year 1, to 9,300 joining in year 2, and 36,800
joining in year 3. Revenue was roughly $700 in year 1, $4100 in year 2, and
$16500 in year 3. Expenses are low so the profit in year 3 was about $14500.
That’s roughly equivalent to £9,700 British pounds. I’d earn more working 28
hours a week at minimum wage. I worked _a lot_ more than that, so as an
experienced software developer have paid a high opportunity cost.

I regularly question my decision to continue pouring so much time into
Readlang. I wonder about the lucrative life of a contractor, or the cushy job
of software developer at a large tech company. I wonder if I’m hurting my
chances of future employment by working so long on my own.

On the other hand, profits have grown 480% over the past year. If this
continues, the future looks good. In year 4 (2016) I would make a typical UK
software developer salary, and by the end of year 5 I’d be financially
rewarded for the risk I’ve taken compared to being employed. But that’s still
**two years away**. And is it even realistic to expect the trend to continue?
I don’t know, but I’m making a bet that while I continue to work on it, the
answer is yes.

There are easier ways of making a living. But I’m proud of what I’m making,
and it seems to _genuinely help people to learn languages_. Here are a couple
of the _many quotes_ I’ve received by email within the past month:

> En primeras palabras quiero decir, que me gusta muchísimo tu pagina. Es de
verdad grande trabajo.

If your Spanish isn’t great, try [reading the above quote on
Readlang](http://readlang.com/library/568a5501ddb6ae5b165d2c33).

> I’m in a polyglot group, and we all try different language tools constantly
(Memrise, Anki, FluentU, etc), but I think Readlang has been the “stickiest”
for the majority of us.

On top of that, prolific language learner Alex Rawlings recently wrote of
Readlang:

> This simple tool has changed the way I learn languages forever.

Feedback like this assures me that I’m doing something right.

Readlang is [ramen
profitable](http://www.paulgraham.com/ramenprofitable.html), helping more
people every day, and there’s still plenty of room for improvement. Of course
I’m continuing.

I plan to write more about creating Readlang. If you’d like to ask a question,
suggest a topic, or hear updates, please find me on twitter

Just a couple more tweaks and usage will explode.
