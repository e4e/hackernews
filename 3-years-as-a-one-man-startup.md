# ぼっちスタートアップの3年

私はここ3年というもの、[Readlang](http://readlang.com) という言語を学習するWebアプリケーション作成に、ほとんどの時間を費やしてきました。

[これを軌道に乗せるための私の苦労について書いた](http://steveridout.com/2014/03/22/readlang-my-bootstrapped-language-
learning-web-app.html)のはもう2年近くも前のことで、[ハッカーニュース](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7450519)などでの反応に興奮したものです。後日談を書きたいと長い間ずっと思っていたのですが、その度に待たなければと気付くのでした。

> もう少しだけいじればずっと使いやすくなる。そうしたら何か書くネタが出来きるぞ！

さて、そして3年が経った今。使い勝手はそれほど変わりませんでしたが、どうにかこうにか成長しました。
3年間ずっと頑張って _いまだに最低限の収入も得られてません_。でも、それは言うほど悪くないです。

To survive as a bootstrapper, revenue is essential. But it’s often taboo,
despite being very useful information. The problem is that if you report a low
revenue, you may not be taken seriously. If you earn a lot, people listen but
it invites competition and jealousy. I’m still on the low side, so here goes…

New signups grew from 2,800 in year 1, to 9,300 joining in year 2, and 36,800
joining in year 3. Revenue was roughly $700 in year 1, $4100 in year 2, and
$16500 in year 3. Expenses are low so the profit in year 3 was about $14500.
That’s roughly equivalent to £9,700 British pounds. I’d earn more working 28
hours a week at minimum wage. I worked _a lot_ more than that, so as an
experienced software developer have paid a high opportunity cost.

I regularly question my decision to continue pouring so much time into
Readlang. I wonder about the lucrative life of a contractor, or the cushy job
of software developer at a large tech company. I wonder if I’m hurting my
chances of future employment by working so long on my own.

On the other hand, profits have grown 480% over the past year. If this
continues, the future looks good. In year 4 (2016) I would make a typical UK
software developer salary, and by the end of year 5 I’d be financially
rewarded for the risk I’ve taken compared to being employed. But that’s still
**two years away**. And is it even realistic to expect the trend to continue?
I don’t know, but I’m making a bet that while I continue to work on it, the
answer is yes.

There are easier ways of making a living. But I’m proud of what I’m making,
and it seems to _genuinely help people to learn languages_. Here are a couple
of the _many quotes_ I’ve received by email within the past month:

> En primeras palabras quiero decir, que me gusta muchísimo tu pagina. Es de
verdad grande trabajo.

If your Spanish isn’t great, try [reading the above quote on
Readlang](http://readlang.com/library/568a5501ddb6ae5b165d2c33).

> I’m in a polyglot group, and we all try different language tools constantly
(Memrise, Anki, FluentU, etc), but I think Readlang has been the “stickiest”
for the majority of us.

On top of that, prolific language learner Alex Rawlings recently wrote of
Readlang:

> This simple tool has changed the way I learn languages forever.

Feedback like this assures me that I’m doing something right.

Readlang is [ramen
profitable](http://www.paulgraham.com/ramenprofitable.html), helping more
people every day, and there’s still plenty of room for improvement. Of course
I’m continuing.

I plan to write more about creating Readlang. If you’d like to ask a question,
